# Beezz  

This project aims to develop an intelligent hive monitoring system based on the analysis of sound frequencies produced by bees. Using a hardware device equipped with a microphone and an iOS app developed in Swift, the system will automatically identify different hive states and send real-time notifications to beekeepers.
