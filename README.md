## Project Overview
Beezzz is an intelligent hive monitoring system that analyzes sound frequencies produced by bees to provide real-time insights into hive conditions. Using a hardware device equipped with a microphone and an iOS app developed in Swift, the system automatically identifies different hive states and sends timely notifications to beekeepers.

## Features
- **Sound Analysis**: Advanced algorithms analyze bee sounds to detect hive status, including swarming alerts and anomaly detection
- **Intuitive Dashboard**: Clear visual indicators and interactive graphs displaying hive health and activity
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Instant alerts for critical events that require immediate attention
- **Hive Management**: Easily add, edit, and track multiple hives in one centralized platform
- **Historical Data**: Access and analyze trends over time to improve beekeeping practices
- **Customizable Settings**: Personalize alert thresholds and monitoring preferences

## Project Structure
The project follows a modular and organized architecture:
- **Components**: Reusable UI components including hive cards, status indicators, and graphs
- **Model**: Data structures for hive information, sound analysis, and notifications
- **View**: Main interfaces including dashboard, hive details, and settings
- **Assets**: Application resources including images and reference sound samples

## Technologies Used
- **Swift** and **SwiftUI** for the iOS application
- **UIKit** for custom interface components
- **Swift Data** for local storage of hive information
- **Custom Hardware** with microphone sensors for data collection
